# Topic

Analyze Crime Data for Austin, TX against other factors such as; access to food, general wealth/ home costs, daily weather events... and offer visualizations of any trends between crime and these other factors.

# Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Leaflet
- Google Maps
- Viz tools -- Tableau, D3 , Plotly
- Web framework -- Flask
- DB - AWS - RDS sql database (if needed)

# Deliverable 1

Success metrics

- Finalize Proposal
  - Display and analyze trends in crime in the Greater Austin area within 2020-2021 (Home Page)
  - Create a clustering machine learning model to see if connections can be seen between crime and; median home values, fresh food availability, weather events. (Machine Learning Pages)
- Find/Gather all needed datasets/ APIs
  - [X] Crime Data
  - [X] Food scarcity
  - [X] Median home values
  - [X] Weather API
- Rough Sketch of What final dashboard/app/website will display, and how it will display it (maybe 3-5 visualizations)
  - **Home Page**
  - Heatmap of Crime in area, depicts main dataset, and shows breakdown of datapoints (Tableau)
    - Paragraphs explaining the dataset, where it was from, cleaning that was done to it, and what is being shown
    - Tableau Heatmaps and Other Visualsizations for trends in Crime Data
      - Austin zipcodes and types of crime
      - Austin zipcodes and time of day crime committed
      - Austin zipcodes and type of location
      - Austin zipcodes and family violence
  - **Machine Learning Pages**
    - Create a clustering data model that will place crime data together with weather data. Display clusters (or lack of clusters) of crime that tend to happen during certain weather events.
    - Create a clustering data model that will place crime data together with food scarcity data. Display clusters (or lack of clusters) of crime that tend to happen within certain food scarcity areas.
    - Create a clustering data model that will place crime data together with median home values data. Display clusters (or lack of clusters) of crime that tend to happen within certain home value neighborhoods.
    - Paragraphs explaining the dataset, where it was from, cleaning that was done to it, and what is being shown
  - **Created By Page**
    - Headshot and short bios of 4 of us
    - Links and descriptions of all datasets and tools used
  - **Documentation Page**
    - Displays the technical documentation for how to build and run this project
      - [ ] Start ReadMe file to document what/how project contains, how to build, etc...

## Timeline

### By Monday Jan 10th

- Complete Deliverable 1

### From Monday Jan 10th - Monday Jan 17th

- Clean and combine all datasets into their final form
- Using tools like Tableau, python, plotly, etc... build visuals, trend analyses models, and one or more machine learning model
  - From data models and datasets, generate 1-3 visualizations minimum
- Launch a basic dashboard to host visualizations
  - Establish hosting platform of data/website/dashboard if needed
- Further document project in ReadMe file
- Generate rough draft of text that will be displayed on dashboard/app to accompany and describe data visuals

### From Monday Jan 17th - Monday Jan 24th

- Complete 3-5 visualizations
- Complete project Documentation on ReadMe file
- Complete texts and visual analysis descriptions
- Offer an Analysis on all data visualizations, what they show
- Determine flow of Presentation
