Analyze Crime Data for Austin, TX (maybe Houston/all of Texas if time permits?) against other factors such as; access to food, general wealth/ home costs, school teacher: student ratio, daily weather... and offer visualizations of any trends between crime and these other factors.

# Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Leaflet
- Google Maps
- Viz tools -- D3, Tableau, Plotly
- Web framework -- Django?
- DB - AWS - RDS sql database
