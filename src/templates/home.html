            This Crime Analysis seeks to delineate a pattern between Crime Data in Austin from 2020-2021, TX zip codes and several 
            different segments within each zip code such as; median household income, food scarcity, daily weather events, and time frames 
            based on monthly and hourly increments. The data pipeline uses Python libraries for ETL into the visualization deployment. 
            Tableau and Unsupervised Machine Learning is implemented to deploy visualizations of trends, if any, between crime and other 
            data points. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The chart below shows the total count of crimes committed in Greater Austin area Zip-codes and each crime was categorized as 
            violent or nonviolent crimes based on the criteria provided by the FBI’s website. This categorization for each crime was achieved 
            by using Python scripts to scan each of the 313 crimes for key words that pertained to those violent crimes, and would assign them 
            ‘V’ for violent crimes and conversely ‘NV’ for nonviolent crimes. The result of the analysis showed that there were significant
            differences between the amount of crimes committed in these zip codes and that the results suggest that those with lower incomes
            experienced higher total crime counts than zip codes with higher average incomes. The data also showed that there were 
            significantly more nonviolent crimes than violent crimes in general.
