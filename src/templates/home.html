            This Crime Analysis seeks to delineate a pattern between Crime Data in Austin from 2020-2021, TX zip codes and several 
            different segments within each zip code such as; median household income, food scarcity, daily weather events, and time frames 
            based on monthly and hourly increments. The data pipeline uses Python libraries for ETL into the visualization deployment. 
            Tableau and Unsupervised Machine Learning is implemented to deploy visualizations of trends, if any, between crime and other 
            data points.

            The chart below shows the total count of crimes committed in Greater Austin area Zip-codes and each crime was categorized as 
            violent or nonviolent crimes based on the criteria provided by the FBI’s website. This categorization for each crime was achieved 
            by using Python scripts to scan each of the 313 crimes for key words that pertained to those violent crimes, and would assign them 
            ‘V’ for violent crimes and conversely ‘NV’ for nonviolent crimes. The result of the analysis showed that there were significant
            differences between the amount of crimes committed in these zip codes and that the results suggest that those with lower incomes
            experienced higher total crime counts than zip codes with higher average incomes. The data also showed that there were 
            significantly more nonviolent crimes than violent crimes in general.

          <p style="font-size: large;"> The first goal of the time analysis was to determine when crimes occur in Austin based on hour intervals throughout the day. 
            In order to look at the total crimes that occured within a 24 hour timeframe in the City of Austin, code was formulated using python's groupby function and pythons datetime 
            converter to group crimes count by each hour (12:00 refers to the time interval 12:00-12:59). The time formatted for based on military time. It was determined that most crimes in the austin area occured between the hours of midnight (00:00) and noon (12:00).  
            The times in which crimes showed a massive decline in frequency was bewteen the times of 00:00 to 8:00, while a consistent rise in crimes occured past 13:00 until 18:00 where they hit a 3rd peak. The average amount of crimes that happen between each out amounted to 
            7779 crimes per hour. This was consistent throughout all zipcodes.
